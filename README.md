## Project Overview

 [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/8l9hDu3i/volunteer-platform-16)

 [Product Canvas](https://www.notion.so/Volunteer-Platform-fcfbaf6317e548de9a310052ad278e6c)

 [UX Design files](https://www.figma.com/file/cLBm5ArTmCT91X2rNbdSeq/Labs16_Volunteer-Platform?node-id=0%3A1)

The goal of this project is to connect volunteers and non-profits together, streamlining the validation process of volunteers to events.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Key Features

-   release canvas 1 
    -  Initial user onboarding (one type of user)
    -  user can create a nonprofit organization; CRUD functionality on events for the nonprofit]
-   release canvas 2 
    -  Users (volunteers) are able to search and filter volunteer opportunities
    -  Users (volunteers) can sign up (or cancel) for a specific event after searching and using interactive filters to find volunteer opportunities close by]
-   release canvas 3 
We unfortunately ran out of time after completion of release canvas 2 but we thought it would be nice if the following features could be incorporated:
    -  Organizations can verify their status via uploading of 501(c)(3) form
    -  Organizations can validate hours after volunteers had completed an event
    -  Users (volunteers) can view history in their profiles that show events that they had completed and hours that they had accumulated
    -  Users (volunteers) can rate the organization (on a scale of 1-5 stars) after they had completed an event

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Tech Stack

### Front end built using:

#### ReactJS

Our groups familiarity is only with React as a FE Framework. We are aware of other viable options (Angular, Vue, Next), however, none of us have familiarity with these frameworks and due to time, these options were not going to be considered. Since most of the group will be introduced to Firebase on the BE, we did not want to also be spending our valuable time learning another framework. React provides us with enough comfort and flexibility for this project. We will utilize React Hooks along with the other many, well-developed npm packages that have been made for React (React Router, React Joyride, etc.). The largest potential challenge we foresee will be state management and separation of concerns for our file structure.

#### Front end deployed to [https://volunteer-platform.netlify.com/]

#### Back end built using:

#### Firebase

We chose firebase for the following reasons:

- New technology that almost no one on the team had used so it is new and exciting to us
- No need to set up backend
- No need to use library like knex. 
- No need to create migration files. 
- Can change as the app changes. 
- Subscriptions
- Google auth comes built in.

#### üö´ back end framework goes here

-   point one
-   point two
-   point three

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication API here

Google autho code
```
 useEffect (() => {
  this.unregisterAuthObserver = firebase.auth()
              .onAuthStateChanged( ( user ) => {
                  if( user ){
                      //user is logged in or just logged out.
                  }else{
                      //user is logged out or just logged out.
                  }

              } );
 }, [])
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Payment API here

We are not using any payment API

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Misc API here

[Geoip-db API](https://geoip-db.com/)

Detect the user's location by IP address, for the purpose of fetching events that are close to the user.

Sample response format
```
 {
  "country_code":"US",
  "country_name":"United States",
  "city": ,
  "postal": ,
  "latitude": ,
  "longitude": ,
  "IPv4": ,
  "state": 
 }
```


# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_apiKey - this is your Google API key, which can be generated in the Google Cloud Console
    *  REACT_APP_authDomain - when you set up your Firebase project, this information will be in the dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_databaseURL - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_projectID - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_storageBucket - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_messagingSenderId - in the Firebase dashboard
    *  REACT_APP_ipinfoKey - API key for Geoip-db

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

üö´Document what you used for testing and why

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

üö´explain how to install the required dependencies to get this project up and running with yarn and NPM

## Other Scripts

üö´replace these examples with your own

    * typecheck - runs the TypeScript compiler
    * build - creates a build of the application
    * start - starts the production server after a build is created
    * test - runs tests in **tests** directory \* eject - copy the configuration files and dependencies into the project so you have full control over them
